# Dog-Activity-Tracker
The Dog Activity Tracker is a motion-based tracking system built on the ESP32-S3 to monitor and classify a dog's activities in real-time. It uses an accelerometer + gyroscope (QMI8658) to detect movement and categorize activities into Resting, Walking, Running, and Playing.

##  Features  

 **Activity Classification** – Detects and categorizes movements  
 **Wake-on-Motion** – Saves power by entering deep sleep mode when inactive  
 **Data Storage with LittleFS** – Logs activity data in 10-minute intervals  
 **Time Synchronization** – Uses **NTP** for accurate timekeeping  
 **BLE Connectivity** – Syncs data with a mobile app (planned feature)  
 **TensorFlow Lite Integration** – Future support for ML-based activity classification  

##  Tech Stack & Dependencies  

- **ESP32-S3** microcontroller  
- **QMI8658** Accelerometer + Gyroscope  
- **ESP32 Arduino Core (v2.0.14)**
