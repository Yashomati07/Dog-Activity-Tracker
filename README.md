# Dog-Activity-Tracker-project-using-ESP32

A project that monitors a dog's activity using an ESP32 microcontroller, a simulated accelerometer/gyroscope, and LittleFS for data storage. The tracker categorizes activities (Resting, Walking, Running, and Playing) and stores the data for easy syncing with a mobile app.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Dog Activity Tracker uses:

- **Simulated Accelerometer**: Emulates a QMI8658 sensor to provide motion data.
- **Activity Classification**: Simple threshold-based system to identify activity types.
- **Data Storage**: Uses LittleFS to log activity in 10-minute intervals.
- **Time Management**: Maintains time with ESP32's RTC and syncs via NTP when Wi-Fi is available.

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Hardware
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller (or compatible ESP32 board)

### Libraries / Dependencies
- ESP32 Arduino Core (v2.0.14)
- LittleFS (filesystem library)
- BLE (for mobile sync - optional)
- ArduinoOTA (for over-the-air updates - optional)
